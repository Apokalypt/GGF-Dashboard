# GGF Dashboard

**Glitch GTA France** (GGF) Dashboard is the official dashboard used by the GGF team to manage a part of the 
configuration of Apokabot on GGF Discord server (10.000+ members).

This website has been developed using native PHP (with composer), HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is hosted for free on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## üöÄ Objectives

The only objective of this website was to provide a simple and fully working dashboard to the GGF team in less than 
10 hours for internal reason. The website is not intended to be used by anyone else than the GGF team and the code has 
not been optimized for performance or security.

*The website may evolve in the future to support more features, to be more user-friendly and to offer interface to
members for some features of the bot.*
